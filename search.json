    "text": "Conceptual and Psychometric Foundations of Socio-Emotional Skills (BESSI)\nTopic:\nPsychometric validation of a short-form instrument to assess socio-emotional skills in adolescents.\nContent:\nIn my master’s thesis, I investigate the conceptual and psychometric foundations of socio-emotional skills measurement, using the German 45-item version of the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory (BESSI-G). A central focus of the thesis is the theoretical distinction between skills and personality traits, particularly the question of whether skill measures capture functional capacities (“I can”) or merely rephrase trait-like tendencies (“I am”).\nBuilding on recent critiques of semantic redundancy in personality and skills research, the thesis examines whether high correlations between skills and traits reflect substantive overlap or arise from near-synonymous item wording. Rather than treating correlations as evidence for construct equivalence, the project approaches this issue from a measurement perspective, emphasizing construct definition, item semantics, and factorial structure.\nMethodologically, the thesis employs longitudinal psychometric models to assess the factorial structure and measurement invariance of the BESSI-G across time, providing a necessary precondition for interpreting change, stability, and intervention effects in socio-emotional competencies.\nMethods:\n\nLarge longitudinal sample of upper secondary students\nExploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM)\nWSMLV vs. ML\nLongitudinal measurement invariance testing\nLatent stability models\nR (lavaan), FIML for missing data"

    "text": "Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Intervention\nTopic:\nCompliance-sensitive causal effects in a digital socio-emotional intervention for preschool children.\nContent:\nI conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial evaluating a digital socio-emotional training program for preschoolers. Beyond standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, I applied Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) models to examine how intervention effects depend on actual usage (compliance).\nMethods:\n\nSecondary analysis of an RCT\nITT vs. CACE comparison\nFIML for missing data\nSensitivity and tipping-point analyses\n\nKey contribution:\nWhile ITT effects were small or absent, CACE analyses revealed stronger effects among high-compliance participants. At the same time, the study critically discusses design-related threats to causal inference (e.g., resentful demoralization, control group issues), illustrating the limits of statistical corrections when design assumptions are violated."
